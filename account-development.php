                            With a significant amount of library budget invested in journal subscriptions it is vital to achieve a strong return on this investment, as well as demonstrating the impact this content has on the overall performance of your institution. With a strong correlation between the use of e-journals and the number of papers published and research grants awarded (Sconul.ac.uk, 2018), every library needs to ensure that the content it has invested in is highly discoverable and widely used. With all that in mind, here are some of the most effective ways to improve journal discovery and usage at your institution.
