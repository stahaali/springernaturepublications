However the position is multi-faceted and requires Editors-in-Chief to perform a variety of tasks and interact with a wide range of people. </p>
                <p>More general information on the role of a Journal Editor at Springer Nature can be found in our Editors’ Information Pack.</p>
                <p>The Code of Conduct for Editors sets out the standards and expectations associated with the role of Editor. These requirements are based on guidelines and best practice recommendations issued by organizations such as the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). Adhering to these will ensure that you are working to the highest standard of editorial practice. </p>
                <p>Springer Nature is a member of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). COPE is an advisory body which provides guidance to editors and publishers on all aspects of publication ethics.</p>

                <h4 class="textgray mt-4 mb-4">As members, we are committed to:</h4>

                <p>We aspire to a positive and proactive approach to preventing publication misconduct and encouraging sound and reliable research practices.</p>
                <p>The Editor-in-Chief is responsible for guaranteeing, a far as possible, the quality and ethics of everything that is published in the journal. A Handling Editor (whether this is an Associate Editor, Section Editor, Region Editor, Special Guest Editor and so forth) should also take responsibility for ensuring the quality of manuscripts which are accepted.</p>
                <p>All Editors work to maintain the highest standards of editorial practice for their journals and we have a clear framework of policies, processes and guidelines designed to help them achieve this.</p>

Springer Nature will support Editor(s) in their pursuit of adhering to such COPE standards. When dealing with publication and research ethics issues, Editor(s) are expected to follow COPE guidance and flowcharts or any guidance provided by Springer Nature (hereafter called the Publisher). The final course of action should be decided by the Editor(s). In difficult cases, or where there is no existing COPE guidance, the Editor(s) may seek advice from the Publisher, and some cases may need to be resolved in collaboration between Editor(s) and the Publisher. The Core Practices and general guidelines and flowcharts are available from the COPE website (http://publicationethics.org).
