                        <p>At Springer Nature, we’re committed to Accessibility and we want to help you make your research accessible too. Many factors regarding accessibility are handled by Springer Nature, but we request you to take some actions as well to help make your research accessible.</p>
                        <p>Write alternative text (alt text) for all figures, illustrations and tables.</p>
                        <p>Alternative text, also known as 'alt text', is a brief description that explains how an image looks or what purpose it serves in a digital format. Alt text is crucial for individuals using screen reader technology, as well as for those trying to comprehend the content of an image in case it doesn't load.</p>
                        <p>Alt text is not the same as a caption, which typically provides information that is not already in the visual element itself.</p>
                        <p>For more tips on how to write good alt text, please visit the Poet Tool.</p>
                        <p>Please note that if you are not able/not willing to create alt text, this will be created for you during the production process by an AI supported tool. You will be asked to edit/approve this text during the proofing stage.</p>
                        <p>Ensure that the figures display adequate color contrast and refrain from relying solely on color to</p>
                        <p>communicate important or essential information.</p>
