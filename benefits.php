                        <p>Open research means access to content is not limited to those with journal subscriptions. Many groups that miss out on subscription content - including researchers at institutions with limited access or funds, individual researchers not affiliated with an institution and the general public - find open access content not only available but valuable.</p>
                        <p>The impact of making research papers freely accessible from the moment of publication can be astonishing, particularly for research in which there is a strong public interest. For example, a Scientific Reports paper exploring the biological impact of the Fukushima nuclear accident on the pale grass blue butterfly was accessed over a quarter of a million times during the first month after publication.</p>
                        <p>To further public engagement, each article published by a Nature Partner Journal includes a plain English overview of the article’s key findings. Presented in a brief, digestible format, this allows researchers in other fields and the interested public to engage with research.</p>

Open access has enabled those outside of research to benefit from new findings. BMC journal Research Involvement and Engagement recently co-published Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and Public (GRIPP2) as a key way for for researchers and patient to understand how they should report involvement and engagement in research papers.</p>
                        <p>In 2017, BMC announced the introduction of Registered Reports in BMC Medicine. BMC Medicine publishes research articles and reviews in all areas of research and practice in medicine and global health.
